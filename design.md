### common design things
- an initialize() is called by the constructor, this alows for the widgets to be
	brought back to thier initial state latter on
- classes in classes are so that there will not be name confilicts in the global scope
- hidden widget in ui files: in order to have some widgets that appear later some widgets are hidden
	they will not be shown by qt creator but still exist in the widget pannel list and can be made visible by
	editing the ui file directly
