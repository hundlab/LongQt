# LongQt Grapher

LongQt Grapher is the same as the graphing portion of LongQt (main). It is a separate tool to alow users to easily 
plot previously run simulations. When selecting the simulation to plot choose the data directory where all the files
were saved from the simulation run. It should now look like graphing tab that LongQt opened when the simulation
initially finished running. On the rest of this page we will document the various features of our grapher.

There are two types of graphs that can be produced. The first is the time series graphs of some output variable vs
time. There will alway be vOld vs time but any others are optional. If measurements were taken on that variable they
will be listed in the right hand table. Below that table are the options to Import Control and to save. The option
to save will save the visible graph as a jpeg. The Import Control option can add one more graph to the plot. It
takes a tsv file with headers that correspond to time and the plotted variable. To select a file generated by LongQt,
navigate to the data files and select one ending in dvars.tsv. The second type of graph is a bar graph for each variable measurement. Again other simulations can be added through the Load Another Trial button. For bar graphs the 
appropriate file to load is one ending in dss.txv.
